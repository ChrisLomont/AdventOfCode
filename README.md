# Advent of code

I was talked into doing Advent of Code 2022, and while doing the first week I also did all of Advent of Code 2021 for practice. These are in C#. I hope to do a blog post about the 2021 problems soon.

- Included are solutions to all of 2021 and (so far) day 9 of 2022.

- Update Dec 24, 2022 - so far I have done the first 24 in 2022, and over the last few weeks for practice I did all of 2019, 2020, and 2021, now all included.
  Update Dec 25, all finished.
